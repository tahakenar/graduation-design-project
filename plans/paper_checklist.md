## Papers to be Implemented

- [ ] Multi-Drug Pharmacokinectic Optimal Control Approach in Cancer Chemotherapy (Kağan & Emir)

- [x] Chemotherapy for tumors: An analysis of the dynamics and a study of quadratic and
linear optimal controls (Kağan & Emir)
  - Simulink model done, simple control methodologies tried. The control methodologies are not necessarily useful in this type of modeling due to the lack of limitation factors such as the healthy cells. More complex and inclusive models are required for the control methodologies to actually mean anything.
